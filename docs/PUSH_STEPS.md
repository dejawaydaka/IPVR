# Step-by-Step Push Instructions

## Current Issue
- SSH key already added ✅
- Authenticated as `sokoyebomlamja` ❌
- Repository belongs to `dejawaydaka` account
- Need write access to `dejawaydaka/IPVR`

## Solution: Use Personal Access Token from dejawaydaka Account

### **Step 1: Create Personal Access Token**

1. **Login to GitHub as `dejawaydaka`**
   - Go to: https://github.com/login
   - Login with `dejawaydaka` credentials

2. **Create Token**
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click: **"Generate new token"** → **"Generate new token (classic)"**

3. **Configure Token**
   - **Note**: `Railway Deployment Token`
   - **Expiration**: Choose 90 days or No expiration (for production)
   - **Scopes**: Check ✅ **repo** (Full control of private repositories)
   - Click: **"Generate token"**

4. **Copy Token**
   - **IMPORTANT**: Copy the token immediately!
   - It looks like: `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
   - Save it somewhere safe

### **Step 2: Push to GitHub**

Run these commands:

```bash
cd /Users/sokoyebom/Downloads/IPVR
git push -u origin main
```

**When prompted:**
- **Username**: `dejawaydaka`
- **Password**: Paste your Personal Access Token (NOT your GitHub password)

### **Step 3: Verify Push**

After successful push, you should see:
```
Enumerating objects: X, done.
Counting objects: 100% (X/X), done.
...
To https://github.com/dejawaydaka/IPVR.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main
Branch 'main' set up to track remote 'main'.
```

## Alternative: Check if Repository Exists

If the repository doesn't exist yet, you may need to create it first:

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `IPVR`
3. Leave it empty (don't initialize with README)
4. Click "Create repository"
5. Then push your code

## If Still Having Issues

Try using GitHub CLI (if installed):
```bash
gh auth login --hostname github.com
# Select: GitHub.com
# Select: HTTPS
# Authenticate as: dejawaydaka
# Then:
git push -u origin main
```

**Once pushed successfully, Railway will auto-detect and deploy! 🚀**
